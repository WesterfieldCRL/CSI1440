//Lab 1

//1.
// What are the differences between the original value and the incremented value? 
// The new value changed the number at the end of the address, and one of the letters at the end changed.
// Is this what you expected?
//2.
// No, I expected it to neatly increment by 1.
//3.
// Provide an explanation of the results
// I think what happened is the address changed to the next available address. So incrementing intPtr by one would change the adress to the adress of one of the other variables in the program.
//4. 
// Explain the difference between *, &, and just the variables name.
// * give the address of the value, which is where the value is stored in memory
// & references the orignal value without creating a copy
// just the variables name creates a copy of the variable in the function, which will prevent the function from changing it.
